## What is LPM?
> LPM is a local password manager used via the Command Line Interface (CLI).
>

## How does it work?
> Your data is written to a certain file after being encrypted. When you need this data, it's decrypted and printed for you! The various other commands such as `edit`, `rm`, and `search` have their own methods but if you really want to know how everything works under the hood, just read the code!

## How do I download it?
> 1) Clone the repository.
> 2) Install all requirements (check requirements.txt).
> 3) Run `mkdir out`, then run `make`.
> 5) Add the path to the executable to your PATH variable.
> 6) Run `lpm` and enjoy :)
