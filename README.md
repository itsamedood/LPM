## What is LPM?
> LPM is a local password manager used via the Command Line Interface (CLI).
>

## How does it work?
> Your data is written to a certain file after being encrypted. When you need this data, it's decrypted and printed for you! The various other commands such as `edit`, `rm`, and `search` have their own methods but if you really want to know how everything works under the hood, just read the code!

## How do I download it?
> Go to [releases](https://github.com/itsamedood/LPM/releases) and download the latest `.zip` that corresponds to your platform.
